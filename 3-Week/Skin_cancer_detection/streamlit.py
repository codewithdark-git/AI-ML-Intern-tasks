    Welcome to the **Melanoma Detection Demo**! üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èüë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

    This model uses a trained deep learning algorithm to detect **melanoma** from skin lesion images. Here's how it works:

    - **Step 1**: Upload an image of a skin lesion.
    - **Step 2**: The model will analyze the image and classify it as either **Benign** or **Melanoma**.
    - **Step 3**: The prediction along with the confidence score will be displayed.

    üì∑ **Upload an image to begin the detection process.**
