## Week 1: Disease Prediction Using Patient Data

**Objective:** Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict diseases such as diabetes or heart disease.

**Tasks:**

1. **Dataset Acquisition:**
   - Download the dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values appropriately.
   - Perform normalization of numerical features.
   - Encode categorical features using suitable encoding techniques.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyze feature distributions and correlations.
   - Visualize data using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

4. **Model Training:**
   - Train models using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate models with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Compare model performances to identify the best-performing algorithm.

**Outcome:** A comprehensive report summarizing the analysis, model performances, and insights.

## Week 2: Cancer Detection Using Histopathological Images

**Objective:** Utilize deep learning to detect cancerous cells from histopathological images.

**Tasks:**

1. **Dataset Acquisition:**
   - Access the [Breast Cancer Histopathology Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images) from Kaggle.

2. **Data Augmentation:**
   - Apply techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling to balance the dataset and enhance generalization.

3. **Model Implementation:**
   - Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
   - Explore Transfer Learning with pre-trained models such as ResNet or VGG16.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Highlight cancerous regions in images using Image Segmentation or Grad-CAM visualization techniques.

**Outcome:** A deep learning model capable of accurately detecting and highlighting cancerous regions.

## Week 3: Medical Image Classification

### 1. Skin Cancer Detection

**Objective:** Classify skin lesions into categories (e.g., benign or malignant).

**Dataset:** [ISIC Skin Cancer Dataset](https://www.isic-archive.com/).

**Steps:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load the dataset and normalize pixel values to [0, 1].
   - Resize images to a fixed size (e.g., 224x224) for compatibility with CNNs.
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. **Data Augmentation:**
   - Apply techniques like random rotation, flipping, zooming, and brightness adjustment.

3. **Model Development:**
   - Utilize a pre-trained CNN model (e.g., ResNet50 or EfficientNet) with transfer learning.
   - Fine-tune the model by replacing the last fully connected layer with a dense layer for binary classification.
   - Use Binary Crossentropy as the loss function and Adam optimizer.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Assess the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Deliverables:**
   - Code file (`skin_cancer_detection.py` or notebook).
   - A short report (1-2 pages) detailing model performance and insights.

### 2. Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays

**Objective:** Classify chest X-ray images as pneumonia-positive or negative.

**Dataset:** [Chest X-Ray Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) from Kaggle.

**Steps:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load and preprocess images (resize to 224x224, normalize pixel values).
   - Divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. **Data Augmentation:**
   - Apply augmentation techniques (e.g., random cropping, rotation, and histogram equalization).

3. **Model Development:**
   - Implement a CNN architecture or fine-tune a pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNet or InceptionV3).
   - Optimize the model with Categorical Crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Use metrics like sensitivity, specificity, and ROC-AUC score.
   - Compare results on augmented vs. non-augmented datasets.

**Deliverables:**
   - Code file (`pneumonia_detection.py` or notebook).
   - A summary report (1-2 pages) on model performance and challenges.

## Learning Goals

- Understand and apply Transfer Learning for medical image classification.
- Gain hands-on experience with data preprocessing and augmentation techniques.
- Comprehend evaluation metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score.
- Explore the impact of fine-tuning pre-trained models on performance.

## Tools & Libraries

- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
- **Hardware:** Google Colab or a local system with GPU support.

## Submission Requirements

1. Code files or notebooks for each task.
2. Reports summarizing findings, challenges, and insights.
3. Model files (optional) and visualizations (charts/graphs) demonstrating results.
4. **Deadline:** End of Week 3.
